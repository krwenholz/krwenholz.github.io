      <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Below you'll find my <code>README</code>. It's an introduction, geared toward new coworkers. I used to bury it more deeply. Now, I think it's good top-level stuff. That said, before we get to it, here are a few other link-worthy pages.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects">Publicly visible projects</a>. The woodworking
section is usually a hit.</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="readme-kyle">README.kyle</h1>
<h2 id="me">Me</h2>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Montana. I used to convince folks I grew up wrestling bears. I
did not. You wouldn't believe how many people believed this.</p>
<p>My wife and I met at University of Puget Sound, married right after college. Our dog entered
the picture in 2019. She's too smart for her own good.</p>
<p>We now live in Tacoma, WA, after a long stint in Seattle.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like to walk, read, cook, play games, and do some woodworking. Some project photos can be
found <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPPR5N7AuE28ucrJPX9brb6XxazXH6ohPlECQ_gxl3nRAepbHHwU6n-_xrqe8Hu0g?key=UHhNRUVld1NlZGc1OGtUWFlpZXNhN0tGUUZIbmtn">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I read the following before my daily journaling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I stand for love, kindness, and gratitude, leading those around me to our most noble selves. It is an exercise in definite optimism and the long view. Pity provides no comfort, and I do not thrive on catastrophe or negativity. I thrive on opportunity, grace, humility, and cultivating quiet moments often. Today is an opportunity to transform.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="how-i-describe-my-role">How I describe my role</h3>
<p>My job as an engineering leader (environment cultivator) is to</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow of individuals and the team for long term success</li>
<li>Drive trust for real, effective conversations</li>
<li>Provide cover when necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="books-and-such-on-my-mind">Books and such on my mind</h3>
<p>These are books, articles, and talks I'm mulling over: i.e. they left an impression.</p>

this page.)</p>
<h2 id="go-to-tools-tactics">Go to tools/tactics</h2>
<h3 id="self-care">Self care</h3>
<p>I'm trying (always present tense) to build world-class self care rituals. These help me show up as my most noble self. Current focuses: early rise, early workout, investments in emotional well-being, and constant, structured learning.</p>
<h3 id="successful-conversations">Successful conversations</h3>
<p>I believe in meetings with an agenda (purpose), conflict (the healthy kind that means
we're tackling thorny problems), and the right audience. Sometimes the last two look a
little like gamesmanship; I promise they aren't. I just happen to be a big believer in
focus and timing.</p>
<h3 id="1-1s">1:1s</h3>
<p>It's amazing what kind of conversations can come up with guaranteed time every week. I leave
the agenda up to my reports but will always have something to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-bit-of-process-systems">A little bit of process (systems)</h3>
<p>I love having goals, but it's impossible to meet them reliably if you're tackling every
one as a wholly new problem. Instead, I tend to focus on putting systems in place. Scott Adams
has <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2013/11/18/goals-vs-systems/">a great post about this</a>. Another framing is to focus on being over doing (see <a href="https://www.landmarkworldwide.com">The Landmark Forum</a>).</p>
<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>I'm just a really big fan of doing things in plain text on the command line, from coding
to note taking.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-really-need-from-my-team">What do I really need from my team?</h2>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>Keep it blunt, rooted in facts/examples, and timely. Please don't wait to tell me during
a yearly review. This goes for feedback about my performance and that of the team (which
are really the same thing). Don't hold back. I won't mind. I will, however, mind if I find
out you did hold back!</p>
<p>I'm not perfect, so I really expect there to be feedback at some point. If I haven't done
something wrong or moderatley foolish all week, I'll consider it a failure of effort on
my end.</p>
<h4 id="when-can-you-give-me-feedback-and-how-should-you-deliver-it">When can you give me feedback and how should you deliver it?</h4>
<p>Any time. I'm happy to take feedback in the middle of a meeting if it's delivered with good
intentions and grace. If you want a private chat, put time on my calendar or just ask me!
I'm also open to just chatting over Slack if video/voice/in person isn't your thing.</p>
<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>
<p>I expect folks to demonstrate high levels of ownership. As a team of adults, nobody is
working entirely alone, but they are responsible for whatever they get assigned and commit
to do. Sometimes this means asking for help and other times it means questioning or pushing
back!</p>
<h3 id="craft">Craft</h3>
<p>I believe software &quot;engineering&quot; is a craft. That means I want a team dedicated to learning,
challenging themselves, interested in all aspects of the problem, and a respect for the
process. A lot of times this shows up in code and designs, but it also comes down to being
professional:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicating clearly</li>
<li>helping share knowledge via brownbags, wikis, etc.</li>
<li>respecting boundaries like working hours</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-i-m-working-on">Things I'm working on</h2>
<ul>
<li>Team level feedback. Having
been raised (in the career sense) on teams with a disdain for sprints and business deadlines,
I misunderstood some of the value in committing a team or individual to deadlines. I now
understand concrete commitments can help create measurable progress and let folks know
something is wrong earlier. Getting good systems in place so measurement happens
naturally is a work in progress.</li>
<li>Holding my peers accountable to the same level as myself. I am vocally self critical to a fault. This leaves room for my personality to assuage others of guilt and chide myself in the same breath.</li>
<li>Not a fault, but I recognize my current position is about to change every week with new expectations and challenges. I'm anticipating this as a season of growth. It's going to be fun!</li>
