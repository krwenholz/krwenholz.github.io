      <p>These are the pieces of work I'm proud of and can be published for you to check
out.</p>
<h2 id="wood-working-gardening-constructing">Wood working/gardening/constructing</h2>
<p>I like working with my hands, learning, and designing, so I build things in
my spare time. You can read about one of them
<a href="http://www.krwenholz.com/2015/10/31/platform-bed">here</a>. I also do my best
to keep a Google Photos album with all of the recent creations
<a href="https://goo.gl/photos/4AnXJGLgpWe1NMvb8">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="turning-point-tales">Turning Point Tales</h2>
<p>I like working with my friends and reading great fiction. We built a site for that.
Check out <a href="https://github.com/krwenholz/ourfirstbigthing">Turning Point Tales</a>. It's just source code now, but we had a blast building a choose your own adventure site.
We sourced most of the works from students at University of Puget Sound. How neat
is that?</p>
<h2 id="ray-tracer-challenge">Ray Tracer Challenge</h2>
<p><a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/">The Ray Tracer Challenge</a>
is an excellent book, and a great way to exercise learning a language. I learned a
bunch of go while working through most of the book. My source can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/krwenholz/ray-tracer">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="budget-visualization">Budget visualization</h2>
<p>I needed a tool for talking about money with my wife. Turns out there wasn't
anything simple enough to talk in terms of buckets but sophisticated enough
to model interest and contributions. My solution was to build something myself
with <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. I think
<a href="http://github.com/krwenholz/budget-visualization">the result</a> was pretty neat.</p>
<h2 id="honors-senior-thesis">Honors Senior Thesis</h2>
<p>4 years in the making, I worked with support vector machines to predict the
tardiness of ferries in the Pacific Northwest. This is the capstone to my work
in the University of Puget Sound's Honors Program.</p>
<h4 id="presentation">Presentation</h4>
<p>This is the <a href="https://github.com/krwenholz/FerryTimeliness/tree/master/Thesis/Presentation">presentation</a>
I gave <em>after</em> writing my paper. You can download the little guy and then
just open the index in your modern web browser.</p>
<h4 id="paper">Paper</h4>
<p>The Honors Program really wanted a paper, so
<a href="https://github.com/krwenholz/FerryTimeliness/tree/master/Thesis/Paper">this</a>
is it. Don't make me say it, but I'm fairly proud of how this worked out.</p>
<h2 id="sustainability-services-collection">Sustainability Services Collection</h2>
<p>My final project was to build an application with some folks in my local
chapter of the ACM. It is very cool, and when I left, the folks in the campus
Sustainability Services department loved it. The application is a real time
way to log the status of recycling bins. Turns out, this is a hard problem!
We used <a href="http://derbyjs.com">Derby</a> to make it live and fun. Possibly not the
best design decision, but the application is destined for small time use (for
now) and as a proof-of-concept. This is likely one of my favorite projects to
have ever worked on. Check out
<a href="https://github.com/krwenholz/SS-Collection">the code</a>.</p>
