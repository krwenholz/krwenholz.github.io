  [ { "title": "Kyle's README", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/readme/", "body": "I like the idea of a README for easier introduction\nand to help folks know my quirks. Check it out!\nBackstory\nI was born and raised in Montana, and I used to convince folks I grew up wrestling bears.\nMy wife and I met at University of Puget Sound, married right after college. Our dog entered\nthe picture in 2019. She's too smart for her own good. We now live in Tacoma, WA, after a long stint in Seattle.\nIn my spare time I like to walk, read, cook, play games, and work with wood. Some project photos can be\nfound here.\nPurpose\nI read the following before my daily journaling.\n\nToday is an opportunity to transform, dream during the day, and cultivate my noble self. I thrive on opportunity and love. I act with integrity, intensity, and joy.\n\nHow I describe my role\nMy job as an engineering leader (environment cultivator) is to\n\nGrow individuals and the team for long term success\nDrive trust for real, effective conversations\nProvide cover when necessary\n\nI love jumping in on the engineering problems, but those are a lot easier when the above goals are accomplished.\nBooks and such on my mind\nThese are books, articles, and talks I'm mulling over: i.e. they left an impression. The list sometimes changes.\n\nThe 5AM Club\nChurchill: Walking With Destiny\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People\nThink in Systems: A Primer\nThe Pragmatic Programmer\nThe Old Man and the Sea\nLess Wrong\nSimple Made Easy\nZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\nThe Five Dysfunctions of a Team\n\n(If you're looking for &quot;fun&quot; books or cookbooks, hit me up! I have a list too long for\nthis page.)\nQuirks and ways of working\n\nI like to repeat and reframe things. A lot. Finding the angle with best leverage is important to moving with power and shared purpose.\nExpect me to put out fast and embarassingly early first drafts for feedback. Then increment quickly.\nLanguage matters to me, a lot. I'll be picky about word choice and\nwriting and how we frame problems. Less is almost always more.\nI mumble/externally subvocalize to understand you better. It makes more sense in\nperson when you don't have to ask if I'm muted.\nMy calendar looks busy, but I'll nuke it if you ask me to.\nI joke, a lot. Sometimes, it's sarcasm, meant in good fun but chastise me if I overstep.\n\nWhat do I need from others?\n\nFeedback: Keep it blunt, rooted in facts/examples, and timely. I'm expecting it! This goes for feedback about my performance and that of the team (which are the same thing). Don't hold back. I won't mind. I will, however, mind if I find\nout you did hold back!\nOwnership: I expect folks to demonstrate high levels of ownership. As a team of adults, nobody is working entirely alone, but they are responsible for whatever they commit to. Sometimes this means asking for help and other times it means questioning or pushing back.\nCraft: I believe software &quot;engineering&quot; is a craft. That means I want a team dedicated to learning, challenging themselves, interested in all aspects of the problem, and a respect for the process. This manifests in code and designs, communicating clearly, helping share knowledge, and respecting boundaries.\n\nGo to tools/tactics\n\nSelf care: I'm trying to build world-class self care rituals. These help me show up as my noble self. Current focuses: early rise, early workout, investments in emotional well-being, and constant, structured learning.\nSuccessful conversations: I believe in meetings with an agenda (purpose), conflict (the kind that means we're tackling worthy problems), and the right audience. Sometimes the last two look a little like gamesmanship; I promise they aren't. I just happen to be a big believer in focus and timing.\n1:1s: It's amazing what kind of conversations can come up with guaranteed time every week. I leave the agenda up to my reports but will always have something to discuss.\nA little bit of process (systems): I love goals, but it's impossible to meet them reliably if you're tackling every one as a wholly new problem. Instead, I focus on putting systems in place. Scott Adams has a great post about this. Another framing is to focus on being over doing (see The Landmark Forum).\nCopilot. Mostly the GitHub kind right now, but I'm a big fan of trying out AI tools to learn the space and level up my own capabilities. Perplexity.ai is also in the rotation.\n\nThings I'm working on\n\nTeam level feedback. Having\nbeen raised (in the career sense) on teams with a disdain for sprints and business deadlines,\nI misunderstood some of the value in committing a team or individual to deadlines. I now\nunderstand concrete commitments help create measurable progress and let folks know\nsomething is wrong earlier. Getting good systems in place so measurement happens\nnaturally is a work in progress.\nHolding my peers accountable to the same level as myself. I am vocally self critical to a\nfault. This leaves room for my personality to assuage others of guilt and chide myself in\nthe same breath.\nNot a fault, but I recognize my current position is about to change every week with new\nexpectations and challenges. I'm anticipating this as a season of growth. It's going to be fun!\n\n" },  { "title": "Resources", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/resources/", "body": "Resources\n\nYou're going to love this.

It only took about two weeks of this for my back to begin hurting\nand my posture to crumble into chaos. I couldn't stand it! So I stood up ;)\nSome research, including a few prompts from Lifehacker,\nled me to consider the idea of a standing desk. I didn't want to commit to\none of the incredibly expensive, but very nice, desks you find through\nconventional shopping means. Not to be deterred, the cheap and effective\nsolution eventually came across my screen: Ikea.\nNederkoorn's great work led me to an awesome solution. So I made the plunge,\nfor less money than I ever expected to spend making my cube awesome.\nNow, it's two days, sore feet, tired legs, and only $20 later. Do I like it?\nYeah pretty much. I think all things take time to appreciate, and this\nprobably will too. For now, my back doesn't hurt, and my cubicle looks\nawesome. I'll have to reevaluate in a month to really have a valid opinion.\n" },  { "title": "Launching LendingShack", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/launching-lendingshack/", "body": "Whew! (You can find &quot;it&quot; here for those impatient enough to\nnot read on.) Joey and I did it. We launched an actual website. After getting on\nwith the CentsLess team, we worked all summer to break in our actual coding\nchops, learn Django, learn the Internets, and build a working product. It was\nan incredible challenge, filled with discouraging and elating moments in droves.\nI never imagined taking on such a massive project so early, but Joey and I\ninspired one another to tackle this together. For us, it was a huge leap to\nproduce something like this. We learned about Django, Heroku, Amazon S3,\nand more HTML/CSS3/Javascript than we ever imagined knowing. I hope to share\nsome of the lessons in technical posts over the coming weeks (time permitting).\nGetting through these technical challenges is something no class experience can\nteach, and I'm really glad I had a partner to work through it with.\nNow that the product is out in the wild, we plan to make it something we can\nabsolutely beam about. This means feature creep! Hopefully not, but classes\nand other distractions might keep us a bit blinded until we wake up to a\ncrashed site one morning.\nThere are many bugs to fix and usability flaws to address. LendingShack\nis, however, something I'm really proud of and excited to continue working on.\nExpect more thoughts on the product and process to come ;)\n" },  { "title": "Sitting down after standing up", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/sitting-down-after-standing-up/", "body": "I had no idea what to write about my experience standing up at work, until I got\nback to school and had to sit down again.\nStanding was definitely the best thing I could do at work and in general.

To skip the boring details,\nlet's just say my back pain went away after starting to stand.\nNow that I'm\nback to classes and a schedule without a regular workspace, I miss having a place\nto stand and type. Some day, hopefully soon, I'll return to my preferred\nlifestyle. For now, I'll just recommend you try it out ;)\n" },  { "title": "Organizing Dotfiles", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/organizing-dotfiles/", "body": "I did it! My dotfiles are pretty well organized now, and I love it. I recently\nswapped out my os only to discover my terminal configuration is now painless.\nAfter installing Git, I just have to clone and then copy things to the correct\nplaces.\nIf you're reading this, you either know what a dotfile is and want to back up\nyours with ease, or you have no idea what I'm talking about. Let's deal with\nthe latter first, then return to what I did with my files.\nWhat's a dotfile?\nA dot file is basically any file beginning with a '.'. More importantly, and\nmore generally, these are your configuration files. Think themes, zsh (or bash)\naliases, Git configurations, Conky stuff, X stuff, Vim stuff, or anything you spent\ntime tweaking the settings for. After tweaking enough settings, you become\nattached to your setup and never want to lose it. This is why you back it up!\nHow did he do it?\nI started by just making a Git repository on Github called dotfiles and cloning\nit to my machine. Then I copied stuff in there and started my version control.\nThis was bad. . . . Why you ask? Well, there are a few reasons.\n\nFiles with a '.' at the front don't show up well in most file managers.\nYou always have to remember to copy your files when you change them and make\na new commit.\nYour process is a bit slow.\n\nAfter a few months, I think I have some nice solutions to these problems.\n\nCopy things in without the '.'. It changes nothing about the contents, and\nyou just have to remember to copy them back with a '.' if you want to restore\na file.\nThis I actually haven't fixed yet, but a quick little Cron job coupled with\n3 will fix it up quickly.\nI made a short shell script! Just call it 'copyscript.sh', toss in a line\nwith 'cp' for every file you want to copy to your repo, and then call it with\n'sh copyscript.sh'. This basically automates the process. My knowledge of\nshell scripting is a bit limited, but I bet you can even do the git commit\nstuff in this.\n\nSo there it is, back up your dotfiles and live a saner life. If you want a\nreally heavy handed way to do it, or some more details, check\nthis out.\n" },  { "title": "Interview Ready", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/interview-ready/", "body": "I'm looking for a job! Well, really I want to find an awesome next\nstep in my career as a software engineer. It's a tough battle to\ntrack down the places I want to work, get application materials\nready, get applications in in the right order (NP-Hard without a\ndoubt), be prompt with my emails, and prepare for those interviews.\nI figure it might be nice to put down some resources and things I\nwish I had known.\nKnow thyself\nHow should you start? Well, make sure you know what you want. I\nwas fortunate enough to work a summer before starting this process\nand have some research experience the summer before. It used to be\nthat I was headed to graduate school, but a summer working, even at\na job I didn't particularly care for, gave me massive feedback on\nhow much I enjoyed practically digging in.\n\nTip 1: Get real, varied experience before you graduate.\n\nStarting out my senior year, I dug into the details of what I liked\nand disliked about my various experiences. This led to what my dad\ncalls a Franklin Graph. (Don't ask me where he got it, since I\ncan't find anything about Franklin Graphs.) The idea is to make\nup a scoring rubric of what you find important in a job. This works\nto help you rank opportunities, prioritize what you want, and\nrecognize situations that just won't work.\n\nTip 2: Figure out what you want, and get it in writing.\n\nSome thoughts on the process\nHow did I start applying? Thankfully, my resume is updated\nregularly, and I have been making massive organizational changes to\nhow I work on over the last few years. It's pretty good now. Try\nputting it under source control as a first step. Your next thought\nshould be to iterate! A good resume will get you past automated\nbots, make recruiters thankful for the aesthetics, and get you an\ninterview.\n\nTip 3: Buff that resume up until Mister Miyagi would be proud.\n\nHopefully you have a career center to look at it wherever you are,\nbut just make sure somebody else looks at your resume. Also\ntry to get an in anywhere you can. Alumni, family friends, and\nfriends of friends can be a great way to get past the initial\nscreening, have an awesome recommendation, and/or get to know a\ncompany really quickly. Pump your resources.\n\nTip 4: Give yourself every advantage.\n\nOnce you get the resume up, you should start applying to places\nyou want to work. Every time you fill out an application, print\nit out or save it. This keeps you from repeating yourself later.\nThe first applications can be tough since you have to put down so\nmuch information, but it gets really fast later on. Most\ncompanies want the same information. Use this to your advantage.\n\nTip 5: Organize and record keep EVERYTHING.\n\nAs to who to apply to first, I'm not sure how to describe it, but\nI think I applied in the wrong order. Many companies have very\ndifferent paces of recruiting. It's also hard to know when\nyou'll hear back. Just keep in mind, if you have a company you\nreally want to work for that you should put everything you can\ninto getting an offer for that company before other deadlines\ncome up. As a reference, 6 weeks seems to be pretty fast for\ngetting a decision from a company after first contact (only\nGoogle and Matasano Security seem to fit in here). A more\nrealistic time frame is probably a few months. In general,\ndon't be terrified of success with companies, but be prepared\nfor the consequences it can bring. You don't want to turn down\na pretty good offer, thinking you'll get a better one, only to\nstrike out later.\n\nTip 6: Even success has consequences.\n\nBut that's a bit morbid! Be optimistic, and just remember you\nhave to be respectful with these companies. Always email\nthem back promptly, spellcheck your communications, use kind\nwords (even for rejections), and respect their time.\n\nTip 7: Every party involved in this process is investing\nsomething.\n\nPreparing for the interviews\nTo wrap up this post (longest yet?), I want to put down the\nresources I have been pointed to, liked, and/or found useful\nin this process:\n\nThe book\nI learned most of my algorithm skills from. You can use\nit as a great way to review, and it makes a nice lifetime\nresource.\nThis book\nreally got me prepped for my interviews. It covers everything,\nand even though it seems old at times, the knowledge is spot\non for everything I've seen so far.\nTry this\nfor even more problems. This book is better as a source\nof problems to practice.\nYou can go to TopCoder for\npractice problems and pretty good articles. The articles\nare a nice way to review strategies, data structures, and\nso much more. It's all free and pretty brief.\n\nThose resources will pretty much cover everything you\nshould already know but need to review.\nClosing up\nLastly, remember\nto stay calm and have fun. Work problems with friends on\nwhite boards, chalk boards, or paper. Stop using a compiler\nor IDE when you practice. Make your practice like your\ninterview and you'll be ready when the time comes.\n\nTip 8: Practice like it's real.\n\nThese tips and thoughts seem to be doing\ngood work for me. It doesn't seem right to give details,\nso I'll just leave it at saying I'm doing well. The\nprocess of applying is humbling and fun. You get to work\ncool, albeit short, problems with really smart folks.\nBest of luck!\n\nNumber one goal: Have fun.\n\n" },  { "title": "Some Vim Window, Tab, and Buffer Commands", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/some-vim-window-tab-and-buffer-commands/", "body": "This is mostly a short record for myself, but here go the basic Vim window,\nbuffer and tab commands I like to use/know. My encouragement to learn effective\nuse of all three stems from this\nnice post.\nWindows\nWindows are for viewing things side by side. I only recently started getting to\nknow these, but they're super useful and make you look like a total badass.\nTo create a new window you &quot;split&quot; your current one using the commands\n:split \n:vsplit \nThese split your window horizontally or vertically, respectively, and open the\ncurrent (or a new file) as a buffer in that new &quot;window&quot;. To navigate you use\n\nCtl - w &lt;h,j,k,l&gt;\n\nIt's that easy! You just use Ctl - w to enter some window command mode and\nsuddenly your next navigation key moves you a window in that direction. It's\npretty awesome. You can close a window by deleting any buffers it currently\nhas open. A nice tutorial can be found at linux.com.\nBuffers\nLove 'em! A buffer is basically an instance of an open file. The only\ncommands I really use are\n\n:bn\n\nfor the next buffer,\n\n:bp\n\nfor the previous buffer, and\n\n:b&lt;num&gt;\n\nto go to the specific buffer number.\nI like to use Mini Buf Explorer\nto see my open buffers and make navigation more easy. A nice tutorial for\ngetting around in buffers (for real) can be found\nhere.\nTabs\nTabs are pretty new for me, but they seem to act like file drawers. It seems\nyou can keep groups of buffers in them. A good tutorial is at\nlinux.com.\nWith the plugin for listing buffers I mentioned earlier, I don't really like\ntabs all that much. I'll probably just stick to using buffers. But the link at\nthe tutorial should help if you're interested.\nBest of luck enjoying all the magic of multiple files in Vim!\n" },  { "title": "CardDav with Fastmail", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/fastmail-carddav/", "body": "So you heard about Fastmail's CardDav beta?\nFinding their setup page lacking?\nSo did I!\nTaking a look at their servers and ports page\n(at the time of this writing) gave me the clues I needed.

I took a lot of time cobbling together\nvarious tutorials and images from across the web and Seattle's many furniture stores to\nfinally settle on a platform bed that looks a lot like Crate and Barrel's\nAtwood bed.\nIt turned out pretty simple and feels solid several months later, so here are the plans!\nMaterials\nMeasurements are for a queen size bed. If you want to work on a\nsmaller bed,\nadjust the length dimensions (last) for the beams and pine boards.\n\nStain colour of your choice\nPre-stain to go with said stain\nMineral spirits\nStandard wood screws\n4 6&quot;, or larger, metal corner braces\n8-10 1x4x60&quot; pine boards for slats to set your mattress on\n2 2x2x80&quot; pine boards for runners to set the slats on\n4 1x4x12&quot; pine boards for connecting beams\n2 4x6x80&quot; cedar beams\n1 4x6x70&quot; ceader beam\n1 4x4x70&quot; cedar beam\n\nTools\n\nDrill\nBrushes or rags for staining\nDrill bits for pre-drilling screw holes\nPalm sander (or just sandpaper if you're a masochist)\n\nSuggestions\nBeam hunting\nHome Depot is great for many projects, but for beautiful cedar (or pine) beams, I went to\na local lumber yard: Dunn Lumber in Seattle.\nThe quality of wood there was significantly better and the guys behind the counter were more\nknowledgeable.\nStaining\nIt's simple: sand it down nicely, wipe clean with a rag and some mineral spirits, and use\npre-stain. The latter will ensure you don't get streaking or splotches. It's amazing.\nPlans and assembly\nYou'll want to set aside a large space for assembly, since you'll have to flip the\nbed over at certain points. Additionally, make sure someone is around to help you do\nthe flipping. This design doesn't really become sturdy until all of the pieces are in\nplace, but once they are, it's a heavy and nigh indestructible son of a gun.\nYou'll want to start by attaching your corner braces and 2x2 runners as shown here:\n\nNote that the corner brace is going to be underneath the runner and you should leave at\nleast an inch of space for the slats to sit on top of the runner. Pre-drilling the runners\nwill ensure they don't split, so only skip that step if you feel really lucky.\nI attached the runners after the corner braces and attaching at least one end to each side\nbeam, so in the image, the upright beam is an end (top or bottom).\nThe order of attachment was such that I ended up with an L then a U and finally my\nnice rectangular frame. At each joint, I attached the corner braces and then the 1x4 on\nthe bottom, as shown in this image:\n\nAttaching the second side was the trickiest becasue we had to flip the bed over and hold\nit steady as we attached the corner braces and 1x4s.\n\nOnce it's all assembled, you're probably wondering, &quot;What do I use for feet?&quot;\nOriginally I used big wooden blocks, but a few months later I headed to my local\nMetal Supermarkets and picked up some steel\nrectangular hollow section:\n\n\nAnd boy do they look good! I didn't bother attaching them since the weight of\nthe frame and mattress keep everything in place. You may want to attach the\nslats your mattress sits on with some screws going into the runners, but that's\nthe last piece of the puzzle and entirely optional!\nAfterthoughts\nI might have chosen to go with cedar boards instead of beams, but the thick look\nof the beams is just spectacular. It looks like someone pulled the bed straight\nout of a mountain man's cabin! The plans should be generally the same if you want to\nuse 2x6 cedar boards instead of beams, but you would need to ensure the 1x4 braces\non the bottom are enough to connect your cedar boards. I'm not sure they would be.\nIf you decide to build your own, take your time, do some research, and start with\nsome smaller projects first. Good luck!\n" } ]
