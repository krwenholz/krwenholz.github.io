It only took about two weeks of this for my back to begin hurting\nand my posture to crumble into chaos. I couldn't stand it! So I stood up ;)\nSome research, including a few prompts from Lifehacker,\nled me to consider the idea of a standing desk. I didn't want to commit to\none of the incredibly expensive, but very nice, desks you find through\nconventional shopping means. Not to be deterred, the cheap and effective\nsolution eventually came across my screen: Ikea.\nNederkoorn's great work led me to an awesome solution. So I made the plunge,\nfor less money than I ever expected to spend making my cube awesome.\nNow, it's two days, sore feet, tired legs, and only $20 later. Do I like it?\nYeah pretty much. I think all things take time to appreciate, and this\nprobably will too. For now, my back doesn't hurt, and my cubicle looks\nawesome.

(You can find &quot;it&quot; here for those impatient enough to\nnot read on.) Joey and I did it. We launched an actual website. After getting on\nwith the CentsLess team, we worked all summer to break in our actual coding\nchops, learn Django, learn the Internets, and build a working product. It was\nan incredible challenge, filled with discouraging and elating moments in droves.\nI never imagined taking on such a massive project so early, but Joey and I\ninspired one another to tackle this together. For us, it was a huge leap to\nproduce something like this. We learned about Django, Heroku, Amazon S3,\nand more HTML/CSS3/Javascript than we ever imagined knowing. I hope to share\nsome of the lessons in technical posts over the coming weeks (time permitting).\nGetting through these technical challenges is something no class experience can\nteach, and I'm really glad I had a partner to work through it with.\nNow that the product is out in the wild, we plan to make it something we can\nabsolutely beam about. This means feature creep! Hopefully not, but classes\nand other distractions might keep us a bit blinded until we wake up to a\ncrashed site one morning.\nThere are many bugs to fix and usability flaws to address.

My dotfiles are pretty well organized now, and I love it. I recently\nswapped out my os only to discover my terminal configuration is now painless.\nAfter installing Git, I just have to clone and then copy things to the correct\nplaces.\nIf you're reading this, you either know what a dotfile is and want to back up\nyours with ease, or you have no idea what I'm talking about. Let's deal with\nthe latter first, then return to what I did with my files.\nWhat's a dotfile?\nA dot file is basically any file beginning with a '.'. More importantly, and\nmore generally, these are your configuration files. Think themes, zsh (or bash)\naliases, Git configurations, Conky stuff, X stuff, Vim stuff, or anything you spent\ntime tweaking the settings for. After tweaking enough settings, you become\nattached to your setup and never want to lose it. This is why you back it up!\nHow did he do it?\nI started by just making a Git repository on Github called dotfiles and cloning\nit to my machine. Then I copied stuff in there and started my version control.\nThis was bad. . . . Why you ask? Well, there are a few reasons.\n\nFiles with a '.' at the front don't show up well in most file managers.\nYou always have to remember to copy your files when you change them and make\na new commit.\nYour process is a bit slow.\n\nAfter a few months, I think I have some nice solutions to these problems.\n\nCopy things in without the '.'. It changes nothing about the contents, and\nyou just have to remember to copy them back with a '.' if you want to restore\na file.\nThis I actually haven't fixed yet, but a quick little Cron job coupled with\n3 will fix it up quickly.\nI made a short shell script! Just call it 'copyscript.sh', toss in a line\nwith 'cp' for every file you want to copy to your repo, and then call it with\n'sh copyscript.sh'. This basically automates the process. My knowledge of\nshell scripting is a bit limited, but I bet you can even do the git commit\nstuff in this.\n\nSo there it is, back up your dotfiles and live a saner life. If you want a\nreally heavy handed way to do it, or some more details, check\nthis out.\n" },  { "title": "Interview Ready", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/interview-ready/", "body": "I'm looking for a job! Well, really I want to find an awesome next\nstep in my career as a software engineer. It's a tough battle to\ntrack down the places I want to work, get application materials\nready, get applications in in the right order (NP-Hard without a\ndoubt), be prompt with my emails, and prepare for those interviews.\nI figure it might be nice to put down some resources and things I\nwish I had known.\nKnow thyself\nHow should you start? Well, make sure you know what you want. I\nwas fortunate enough to work a summer before starting this process\nand have some research experience the summer before. It used to be\nthat I was headed to graduate school, but a summer working, even at\na job I didn't particularly care for, gave me massive feedback on\nhow much I enjoyed practically digging in.\n\nTip 1: Get real, varied experience before you graduate.\n\nStarting out my senior year, I dug into the details of what I liked\nand disliked about my various experiences. This led to what my dad\ncalls a Franklin Graph. (Don't ask me where he got it, since I\ncan't find anything about Franklin Graphs.) The idea is to make\nup a scoring rubric of what you find important in a job. This works\nto help you rank opportunities, prioritize what you want, and\nrecognize situations that just won't work.\n\nTip 2: Figure out what you want, and get it in writing.\n\nSome thoughts on the process\nHow did I start applying? Thankfully, my resume is updated\nregularly, and I have been making massive organizational changes to\nhow I work on over the last few years. It's pretty good now. Try\nputting it under source control as a first step. Your next thought\nshould be to iterate! A good resume will get you past automated\nbots, make recruiters thankful for the aesthetics, and get you an\ninterview.\n\nTip 3: Buff that resume up until Mister Miyagi would be proud.\n\nHopefully you have a career center to look at it wherever you are,\nbut just make sure somebody else looks at your resume. Also\ntry to get an in anywhere you can. Alumni, family friends, and\nfriends of friends can be a great way to get past the initial\nscreening, have an awesome recommendation, and/or get to know a\ncompany really quickly. Pump your resources.\n\nTip 4: Give yourself every advantage.\n\nOnce you get the resume up, you should start applying to places\nyou want to work. Every time you fill out an application, print\nit out or save it. This keeps you from repeating yourself later.\nThe first applications can be tough since you have to put down so\nmuch information, but it gets really fast later on. Most\ncompanies want the same information. Use this to your advantage.\n\nTip 5: Organize and record keep EVERYTHING.\n\nAs to who to apply to first, I'm not sure how to describe it, but\nI think I applied in the wrong order. Many companies have very\ndifferent paces of recruiting. It's also hard to know when\nyou'll hear back. Just keep in mind, if you have a company you\nreally want to work for that you should put everything you can\ninto getting an offer for that company before other deadlines\ncome up. As a reference, 6 weeks seems to be pretty fast for\ngetting a decision from a company after first contact (only\nGoogle and Matasano Security seem to fit in here). A more\nrealistic time frame is probably a few months. In general,\ndon't be terrified of success with companies, but be prepared\nfor the consequences it can bring. You don't want to turn down\na pretty good offer, thinking you'll get a better one, only to\nstrike out later.\n\nTip 6: Even success has consequences.\n\nBut that's a bit morbid! Be optimistic, and just remember you\nhave to be respectful with these companies. Always email\nthem back promptly, spellcheck your communications, use kind\nwords (even for rejections), and respect their time.\n\nTip 7: Every party involved in this process is investing\nsomething.\n\nPreparing for the interviews\nTo wrap up this post (longest yet?), I want to put down the\nresources I have been pointed to, liked, and/or found useful\nin this process:\n\nThe book\nI learned most of my algorithm skills from. You can use\nit as a great way to review, and it makes a nice lifetime\nresource.\nThis book\nreally got me prepped for my interviews. It covers everything,\nand even though it seems old at times, the knowledge is spot\non for everything I've seen so far.\nTry this\nfor even more problems. This book is better as a source\nof problems to practice.\nYou can go to TopCoder for\npractice problems and pretty good articles. The articles\nare a nice way to review strategies, data structures, and\nso much more. It's all free and pretty brief.\n\nThose resources will pretty much cover everything you\nshould already know but need to review.\nClosing up\nLastly, remember\nto stay calm and have fun. Work problems with friends on\nwhite boards, chalk boards, or paper. Stop using a compiler\nor IDE when you practice. Make your practice like your\ninterview and you'll be ready when the time comes.\n\nTip 8: Practice like it's real.\n\nThese tips and thoughts seem to be doing\ngood work for me. It doesn't seem right to give details,\nso I'll just leave it at saying I'm doing well. The\nprocess of applying is humbling and fun. You get to work\ncool, albeit short, problems with really smart folks.\nBest of luck!\n\nNumber one goal: Have fun.\n\n" },  { "title": "Some Vim Window, Tab, and Buffer Commands", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/some-vim-window-tab-and-buffer-commands/", "body": "This is mostly a short record for myself, but here go the basic Vim window,\nbuffer and tab commands I like to use/know. My encouragement to learn effective\nuse of all three stems from this\nnice post.\nWindows\nWindows are for viewing things side by side. I only recently started getting to\nknow these, but they're super useful and make you look like a total badass.\nTo create a new window you &quot;split&quot; your current one using the commands\n:split \n:vsplit \nThese split your window horizontally or vertically, respectively, and open the\ncurrent (or a new file) as a buffer in that new &quot;window&quot;. To navigate you use\n\nCtl - w &lt;h,j,k,l&gt;\n\nIt's that easy! You just use Ctl - w to enter some window command mode and\nsuddenly your next navigation key moves you a window in that direction. It's\npretty awesome. You can close a window by deleting any buffers it currently\nhas open. A nice tutorial can be found at linux.com.\nBuffers\nLove 'em! A buffer is basically an instance of an open file. The only\ncommands I really use are\n\n:bn\n\nfor the next buffer,\n\n:bp\n\nfor the previous buffer, and\n\n:b&lt;num&gt;\n\nto go to the specific buffer number.\nI like to use Mini Buf Explorer\nto see my open buffers and make navigation more easy. A nice tutorial for\ngetting around in buffers (for real) can be found\nhere.\nTabs\nTabs are pretty new for me, but they seem to act like file drawers. It seems\nyou can keep groups of buffers in them. A good tutorial is at\nlinux.com.\nWith the plugin for listing buffers I mentioned earlier, I don't really like\ntabs all that much. I'll probably just stick to using buffers. But the link at\nthe tutorial should help if you're interested.\nBest of luck enjoying all the magic of multiple files in Vim!\n" },  { "title": "CardDav with Fastmail", "url": "http://www.krwenholz.com/posts/fastmail-carddav/", "body": "So you heard about Fastmail's CardDav beta?\nFinding their setup page lacking?\nSo did I!\nTaking a look at their servers and ports page\n(at the time of this writing) gave me the clues I needed.
