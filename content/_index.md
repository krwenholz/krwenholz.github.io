Hi there! You've reached Kyle Wenholz's homepage. You'll find links and some writing on this site.

### Some links:

- [Publicly visible projects](/projects). The woodworking
  section is usually a hit.
- My [handy-dandy resume](https://github.com/krwenholz/Resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-wenholz/), which is allowed to run a bit longer than my ~~one~~two page resume ;)
- [My manager README](/readme). 
- [My posts](/posts).
