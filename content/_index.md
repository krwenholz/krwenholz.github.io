Hi there!

My name is Kyle Wenholz, and this is my attempt at a website.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

Some years ago, I finished studying Mathematics and (two degrees yeah!)
Computer Science at [University of Puget Sound](http://pugetsound.edu),
in the lovely city of Tacoma, Washington. Post-graduation, I started work
at an awesome book company writing software to manage reverse-logistics.

After learning more lessons than this paragraph will allow, I
headed off to work for a modest cloud services provider (formerly known as
a search engine company). Both are what you'd call great gigs with brilliant
co-workers, challenges, and perks. I've learned to ask hard questions,
work _with_ users, write reliable and performant software, plan projects,
work with a business team, and have fun while doing it.

I then took a several year turn at a [Seattle-based startup](http://karat.io/)
improving the world's interviewing and hiring tools, one byte at a time.
All sorts of growth and changes happened even before I spent half my time
leading teams. That change in roles eventually led me to my latest adventure....

[ngrok](http://ngrok.com)! (Never going to get over not capitalizing the name.)
We build "tunnels" or, as I like to say, magic load balancers. The folks here
are a big part of that magic, very proud to be part of the team.

You can check out some of my publicly visible projects [here](/projects) (the woodworking
section is usually a hit).
My work history is available in in a handy-dandy
[resume](https://github.com/krwenholz/Resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).
