I had no idea what to write about my experience standing up at work, until I got
back to school and had to sit down again.

Standing was definitely the best thing I could do at work and in general. I
felt in better shape, more alert, and generally happier about my day. It
might sound silly, but sitting down is exhausting. To skip the boring details,
let's just say my back pain went away after starting to stand.

Now that I'm
back to classes and a schedule without a regular workspace, I miss having a place
to stand and type. Some day, hopefully soon, I'll return to my preferred
lifestyle. For now, I'll just recommend you try it out ;)
