I know it's a fad by now, but I just switched over to a stand-up desk.

After getting into the groove of things, my job had me sitting down most of
the time. It only took about two weeks of this for my back to begin hurting
and my posture to crumble into chaos. I couldn't stand it! So I stood up ;)

Some research, including a few prompts from [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com),
led me to consider the idea of a standing desk. I didn't want to commit to
one of the incredibly expensive, but very nice, desks you find through
conventional shopping means. Not to be deterred, the cheap and effective
solution eventually came across my screen: [Ikea](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html).

Nederkoorn's great work led me to an awesome solution. So I made the plunge,
for less money than I ever expected to spend making my cube awesome.

Now, it's two days, sore feet, tired legs, and only \$20 later. Do I like it?
Yeah pretty much. I think all things take time to appreciate, and this
probably will too. For now, my back doesn't hurt, and my cubicle looks
awesome. I'll have to reevaluate in a month to really have a valid opinion.
