back to school and had to sit down again.</p><p>Standing was definitely the best thing I could do at work and in general. I
felt in better shape, more alert, and generally happier about my day. It
might sound silly, but sitting down is exhausting. To skip the boring details,
let&rsquo;s just say my back pain went away after starting to stand.</p><p>Now that I&rsquo;m
back to classes and a schedule without a regular workspace, I miss having a place
to stand and type. Some day, hopefully soon, I&rsquo;ll return to my preferred
lifestyle. For now, I&rsquo;ll just recommend you try it out ;)</p></div></div></div></body></html>
