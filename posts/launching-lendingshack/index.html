      <p>Whew! (You can find &quot;it&quot; <a href="http://lendingshack.com">here</a> for those impatient enough to
not read on.) Joey and I did it. We launched an actual website. After getting on
with the CentsLess team, we worked all summer to break in our actual coding
chops, learn Django, learn the Internets, and build a working product. It was
an incredible challenge, filled with discouraging and elating moments in droves.</p>
<p>I never imagined taking on such a massive project so early, but Joey and I
inspired one another to tackle this together. For us, it was a huge leap to
produce something like this. We learned about Django, Heroku, Amazon S3,
and more HTML/CSS3/Javascript than we ever imagined knowing. I hope to share
some of the lessons in technical posts over the coming weeks (time permitting).
Getting through these technical challenges is something no class experience can
teach, and I'm really glad I had a partner to work through it with.</p>
<p>Now that the product is out in the wild, we plan to make it something we can
absolutely beam about. This means feature creep! Hopefully not, but classes
and other distractions might keep us a bit blinded until we wake up to a
crashed site one morning.</p>
<p>There are many bugs to fix and usability flaws to address. <a href="http://lendingshack.com">LendingShack</a>
is, however, something I'm really proud of and excited to continue working on.
Expect more thoughts on the product and process to come ;)</p>
