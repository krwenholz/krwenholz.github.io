      <p>I'm looking for a job! Well, really I want to find an awesome next
step in my career as a software engineer. It's a tough battle to
track down the places I want to work, get application materials
ready, get applications in in the right order (NP-Hard without a
doubt), be prompt with my emails, and prepare for those interviews.
I figure it might be nice to put down some resources and things I
wish I had known.</p>
<h3 id="know-thyself">Know thyself</h3>
<p>How should you start? Well, make sure you know what you want. I
was fortunate enough to work a summer before starting this process
and have some research experience the summer before. It used to be
that I was headed to graduate school, but a summer working, even at
a job I didn't particularly care for, gave me massive feedback on
how much I enjoyed <em>practically</em> <em>digging</em> <em>in</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 1: Get real, varied experience before you graduate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting out my senior year, I dug into the details of what I liked
and disliked about my various experiences. This led to what my dad
calls a <em>Franklin</em> <em>Graph</em>. (Don't ask me where he got it, since I
can't find <strong>anything</strong> about Franklin Graphs.) The idea is to make
up a scoring rubric of what you find important in a job. This works
to help you rank opportunities, prioritize what you want, and
recognize situations that just won't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 2: Figure out what you want, and get it in writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="some-thoughts-on-the-process">Some thoughts on the process</h3>
<p>How did I start applying? Thankfully, my resume is updated
regularly, and I have been making massive organizational changes to
how I work on over the last few years. It's pretty good now. Try
putting it under source control as a first step. Your next thought
should be to iterate! A good resume will get you past automated
bots, make recruiters thankful for the aesthetics, and get you an
interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 3: Buff that resume up until Mister Miyagi would be proud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully you have a career center to look at it wherever you are,
but just make sure <strong>somebody</strong> else looks at your resume. Also
try to get an <em>in</em> anywhere you can. Alumni, family friends, and
friends of friends can be a great way to get past the initial
screening, have an awesome recommendation, and/or get to know a
company really quickly. Pump your resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 4: Give yourself every advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you get the resume up, you should start applying to places
you want to work. Every time you fill out an application, print
it out or save it. This keeps you from repeating yourself later.
The first applications can be tough since you have to put down so
much information, but it gets really fast later on. Most
companies want the same information. Use this to your advantage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 5: Organize and record keep EVERYTHING.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to who to apply to first, I'm not sure how to describe it, but
I think I applied in the wrong order. Many companies have very
different paces of recruiting. It's also hard to know when
you'll hear back. Just keep in mind, if you have a company you
really want to work for that you should put everything you can
into getting an offer for that company before other deadlines
come up. As a reference, 6 weeks seems to be pretty fast for
getting a decision from a company after first contact (only
Google and Matasano Security seem to fit in here). A more
realistic time frame is probably a few months. In general,
don't be terrified of success with companies, but be prepared
for the consequences it can bring. You don't want to turn down
a pretty good offer, thinking you'll get a better one, only to
strike out later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 6: Even success has consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that's a bit morbid! Be optimistic, and just remember you
have to be respectful with these companies. Always email
them back promptly, spellcheck your communications, use kind
words (even for rejections), and respect their time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 7: Every party involved in this process is investing
something.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-interviews">Preparing for the interviews</h3>
<p>To wrap up this post (longest yet?), I want to put down the
resources I have been pointed to, liked, and/or found useful
in this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356923243&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=skiena">book</a>
I learned <em>most</em> of my algorithm skills from. You can use
it as a great way to review, and it makes a nice lifetime
resource.</li>
<li>This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Programmer/dp/047012167X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356923330&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=programming+interview">book</a>
really got me prepped for my interviews. It covers everything,
and even though it seems old at times, the knowledge is spot
on for everything I've seen so far.</li>
<li>Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Fourth-Programming/dp/145157827X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356923408&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview">this</a>
for even more problems. This book is better as a source
of problems to practice.</li>
<li>You can go to <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> for
practice problems and pretty good articles. The articles
are a nice way to review strategies, data structures, and
so much more. It's all free and pretty brief.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those resources will pretty much cover everything you
should already know but need to review.</p>
<h3 id="closing-up">Closing up</h3>
<p>Lastly, remember
to stay calm and have fun. Work problems with friends on
white boards, chalk boards, or paper. Stop using a compiler
or IDE when you practice. Make your practice like your
interview and you'll be ready when the time comes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip 8: Practice like it's real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These tips and thoughts seem to be doing
good work for me. It doesn't seem right to give details,
so I'll just leave it at saying I'm doing well. The
process of applying is humbling and fun. You get to work
cool, albeit short, problems with really smart folks.
Best of luck!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number one goal: Have fun.</p>
</blockquote>
