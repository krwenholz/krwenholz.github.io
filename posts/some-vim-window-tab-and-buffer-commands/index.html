      <p>This is mostly a short record for myself, but here go the basic Vim window,
buffer and tab commands I like to use/know. My encouragement to learn effective
use of all three stems from <a href="http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/buffers-windows-tabs/">this</a>
nice post.</p>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>Windows are for viewing things side by side. I only recently started getting to
know these, but they're super useful and make you look like a total badass.
To create a new window you &quot;split&quot; your current one using the commands</p>
<p>:split <filename optional>
:vsplit <filename optiona></p>
<p>These split your window horizontally or vertically, respectively, and open the
current (or a new file) as a buffer in that new &quot;window&quot;. To navigate you use</p>
<pre><code>Ctl - w &lt;h,j,k,l&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It's that easy! You just use <strong>Ctl - w</strong> to enter some window command mode and
suddenly your next navigation key moves you a window in that direction. It's
pretty awesome. You can close a window by deleting any buffers it currently
has open. A nice tutorial can be found at <a href="http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/442415-vim-tips-using-viewports">linux.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="buffers">Buffers</h2>
<p>Love 'em! A buffer is basically an instance of an open file. The only
commands I really use are</p>
<pre><code>:bn
</code></pre>
<p>for the next buffer,</p>
<pre><code>:bp
</code></pre>
<p>for the previous buffer, and</p>
<pre><code>:b&lt;num&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>to go to the specific buffer number.</p>
<p>I like to use <a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=159">Mini Buf Explorer</a>
to see my open buffers and make navigation more easy. A nice tutorial for
getting around in buffers (for real) can be found
<a href="http://usevim.com/2012/03/23/buffers/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tabs">Tabs</h2>
<p>Tabs are pretty new for me, but they seem to act like file drawers. It seems
you can keep groups of buffers in them. A good tutorial is at
<a href="https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/442422-vim-tips-using-tabs">linux.com</a>.
With the plugin for listing buffers I mentioned earlier, I don't really like
tabs all that much. I'll probably just stick to using buffers. But the link at
the tutorial should help if you're interested.</p>
<p>Best of luck enjoying all the magic of multiple files in Vim!</p>
